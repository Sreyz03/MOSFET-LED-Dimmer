# MOSFET-Based LED Dimmer (555 PWM → IRFZ44N)

![Circuit Diagram](images/circuit_diagram.png)

## Overview
This project implements an LED dimmer using Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) generated by a **555 timer**.  
The PWM drives an **N-channel MOSFET (IRFZ44N)** which switches the LED load. Adjusting the potentiometer changes the PWM duty cycle and therefore the perceived brightness of the LED.

## 🔍 Working Principle

### 1. PWM Generation
The 555 timer is configured in **astable mode** to produce a square wave whose **duty cycle** is adjustable using the potentiometer.  
Two diodes (1N4148 and 1N4007) separate the charge and discharge paths of the timing capacitor, allowing independent control of ON and OFF durations.

The approximate duty cycle is:

\[
D = \frac{R_A + R_B}{R_A + 2R_B} \times 100\%
\]

Here:
- RA = 1kΩ  
- RB = 50kΩ (Potentiometer)

As RB increases, the duty cycle decreases — the LED becomes dimmer.

### 2. MOSFET Switching
The PWM output from the 555 is connected to the **Gate** of the MOSFET through R1.  
- When PWM is **HIGH**, the MOSFET conducts, powering the LED.  
- When PWM is **LOW**, the MOSFET turns OFF, cutting current to the LED.  

Thus, varying the duty cycle controls the average LED current and brightness.  
A logic-level MOSFET (e.g., IRLZ44N) is ideal for low-voltage control.

### 3. Protection & Stability
- **1N4007 Flyback Diode**: Protects the circuit from voltage spikes (important if the load has inductance).  
- **1N4148 Diode**: Creates asymmetric charge/discharge paths in the timing network.  
- **C1 Capacitor**: Provides timing and decoupling stability.  
- **R1 (1kΩ)**: Limits gate charging current and prevents ringing.

### 4. PWM Frequency and Brightness
A PWM frequency between **500 Hz and 2 kHz** ensures:
- Smooth LED dimming (no visible flicker)
- Efficient switching with low heat loss

At **10% duty cycle**, the LED is dim.  
At **90% duty cycle**, the LED appears bright.
